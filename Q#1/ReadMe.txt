In question number 1, I make a basic front end with basic colorings and widths where the posts data is displaying.

I read data from url "https://dummyjson.com/posts" and display on web page. 
Content: Reactions number, user id,title and body content.

I use plain HTML and CSS for Front end.
I use jQuery for getting and displaying posts with usin ajax and function names are similar to it.
There is small issue with my buttons but it slightly working.
